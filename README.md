> Be proud of who you are and stop comparing yourself with others.. remember you are the magical creation of the Universe. You are uniquely created like your unique DNA , like your unique thumbprint,like a snowflake. you are amazing creation of the Universe.
When you compare yourself to others , you forget who really you are.
You compare your weakest self to their strongest self. As a result you feel insecure, weak and even worthless.
If you have to compare or compete with someone then that person should be someone who you were in the past. So that you will be getting better, happier and stronger.
Always remember The Universe has created you with utmost love and happiness. <br/>
You are Magical! <br/>
You are Unique! <br/>
You are Awesome!
